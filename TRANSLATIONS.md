## Translating Webbkoll

You are very welcome to help us translate Webbkoll to languages other than English/Swedish.

For this purpose we use the translation tool Weblate; see https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/webbkoll/,
where you can create an account and start translating.

The base language is English. Languages currently available for translation are:

* French
* German
* Norwegian (Bokm√•l)
* Swedish (this one we handle ourselves)

If you wish to add another language, or if you have any issues, just email us at info@dataskydd.net.
