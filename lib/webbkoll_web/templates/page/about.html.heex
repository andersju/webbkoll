  <h2><%= gettext "About" %></h2>
  <p><%= gettext "Webbkoll monitors privacy-enhancing features on websites, and helps you find out who is letting you exercise control over your privacy. We check to what extent a website monitors your behaviour and how much they gossip about the monitoring to third parties, based on what can be observed when visiting a given page. Weâ€™ve also compiled a set of recommendations for how to not track or gossip in digital environments." %></p>

  <h3 id="how"><%= gettext "How it works" %></h3>

  <p><%= gettext(~s|Webbkoll attempts to simulate what happens when a user visits a page with a typical browser without interacting with anything. The specified page is visited with <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>, the browser that Google Chrome is based on; i.e., a typical end-user browser. Data (requests/responses, cookies, etc.) is collected, analyzed and presented. The browser has no addons/extensions installed, and Do Not Track (DNT) is not enabled (since this is the default setting in most browsers). Nothing is clicked, no consent is given.|) |> raw() %></p>

  <h3 id="limitations"><%= gettext "Limitations" %></h3>
  <p><%= gettext(~s|Webbkoll can only observe what happens when visiting a single page. It cannot tell you how the website is doing as a whole, how data is stored internally, what parties the data might be shared with, if the privacy policy is adequate, how the internal procedures are, and so on and so forth. A "good" Webbkoll result doesn't mean that everything is well (but a "bad" result certainly means that not all is well).|) %></p>

  <p><%= gettext(~s|This tool is primarly meant to be used as a starting point for web developers. It can only help with one piece of the puzzle.|) %></p>

  <p><%= gettext(~s|Webbkoll is developed by <a href="https://anders.unix.se/">Anders Jensen-Urstad</a> (programming, design) and <a href="https://twitter.com/teirdes">Amelia Andersdotter</a> (FAQ, legislative information) of <a href="https://dataskydd.net/">Dataskydd.net</a>, a Swedish non-governmental organization working on making data protection easy in law and in practice.

  <p><%= gettext(~s|Webbkoll uses <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix Framework</a> (Elixir), <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> and numerous open source libraries; <a href="https://github.com/andersju/webbkoll#credits--licenses">see here</a> for specifics.|) |> raw %></p>

  <p><%= gettext(~s|The initial development of Webbkoll was funded by <a href="https://www.internetfonden.se">Internetfonden</a> / <a href="https://www.iis.se">IIS</a> in 2016.

  <p><%= gettext(~s|The only other similar service that we are aware of <em>that uses a real browser for testing</em> is <a href="https://privacyscore.org/">PrivacyScore</a> (open source).
