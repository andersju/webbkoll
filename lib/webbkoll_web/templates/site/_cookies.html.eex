        <%= gettext(~s|Storing information or gaining access to information stored in the visitors' devices, for instance in the form of cookies, has been subject to sui generis legislation in the European Union (<a href="%{epd}">ePD, Art. 5.3</a>). These sui generis laws have tried to make a distinction between information stored to support technical features and information stored to support commercial features. In practice, poor enforcement of these rules has made the legal landscape unclear. Because there exists no legal duty for citizens to receive better targeted advertisement, nor a legal duty for citizens to assist web developers in improving web sites, it's doubtful that a legal basis exists for storing information to support commercial features without the consent of the web visitor (GDPR %{gdpr_art_7}). It is argued that the legitimate interests of a web site owner (%{gdpr_art_6_1_f}, %{gdpr_art_6_4}) may nevertheless enable them to subject a visitor to targeted ads or cause a visitor to assist the web developers. Then there must exist relevant and appropriate relationship between the web visitor and the web site owner in situations (GDPR %{gdpr_rec_47}), which calls into question the use of third-party service first-party cookies. In either case, if the legitimate interest legal basis for processing is invoked, adequate security measures must be undertaken (GDPR %{gdpr_art_32}).|,
